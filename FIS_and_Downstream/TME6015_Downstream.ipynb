    "This file serves to host the downstream integration of our project for TME 6015: AI/ML Workflow Design. The integration that was used pertains to a simulated task allocation scenario within a warehouse environment. Tasks within the warehouse can have three different load requirements: *Small*, *Medium*, or *Large*, and robots can have a similar load capacity denoted by *Small*, *Medium*, or *Large*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Robots are also defined by their distance to the task, their load history, and their travel history. The goal is therefore to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Allocate a robot with a matching capability to the task requirement;\n",
    "* Prioritize robots with a low load history;\n",
    "* Prioritize robots that are closer to the task;\n",
    "* Prioritize robots that have not travelled far at the time of allocation, and;\n",
    "* To accomplish the aforementioned goals using our ANN architecture. \n",
